```markdown
1. **Define the Problem**
   - Gather detailed information
   - Ask clarifying questions
   - Identify symptoms vs. causes
   - Determine scope and impact
   - Document initial observations

2. **Analyze the Issue**
   - Break down into components
   - Identify patterns or anomalies
   - Check system logs and metrics
   - Replicate the issue if possible
   - Determine root cause

3. **Generate Solutions**
   - Brainstorm multiple approaches
   - Evaluate pros and cons
   - Consider short-term vs. long-term fixes
   - Assess risks and impacts
   - Select optimal solution

4. **Implement the Fix**
   - Create an implementation plan
   - Prepare rollback procedures
   - Make one change at a time
   - Document each step
   - Test thoroughly

5. **Verify and Document**
   - Confirm resolution with user
   - Monitor system stability
   - Document the solution
   - Update knowledge base
   - Schedule follow-up if needed
```

### 1.2 Problem-Solving Mindsets

4. Check for memory leaks
5. Optimize startup programs

## Slow System Boot
1. Check startup programs
2. Verify disk health
3. Check for driver issues
4. Disable unnecessary services
5. Consider SSD upgrade
```

### 4.2 Network Problems
```markdown
## Intermittent Connectivity
1. Check physical connections
2. Test with different devices
3. Check for IP conflicts
4. Update network drivers

2. Test with different DNS servers
3. Check hosts file
4. Verify network settings
5. Check for DNS poisoning
```

## 5. Advanced Problem-Solving Techniques

### 5.1 Systematic Elimination
```markdown
## Process
1. Divide system into components
2. Test each component independently
3. Isolate the faulty component
4. Verify with replacement/repair
5. Document findings

## Example: Network Printer
1. Test with different computer
2. Try different cable/port
3. Check print server status
4. Test with different document
5. Verify driver installation
```

### 5.2 Binary Search Method
```markdown
## Implementation
1. Sort components by likelihood
2. Test at midpoint
3. Determine if issue is before or after
4. Repeat with narrowed scope
5. Isolate to specific component

## Example: Software Installation
1. Check system requirements
2. Verify installation media
3. Check for conflicting software
4. Review installation logs
5. Test with clean boot
