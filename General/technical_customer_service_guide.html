<pre class="codehilite"><code class="language-markdown">## Shift in Perspective
- From: &quot;This is a technical problem to solve&quot;
- To: &quot;There's a person who needs help with technology&quot;

## Key Realizations
- Users don't care about technology, they care about results
- Frustration is usually about the situation, not you personally
- Your patience can defuse tense situations
- Clear communication is as important as technical skill
- Every interaction is a chance to build trust

- DO maintain eye contact (in person/video)
- DO nod and use verbal acknowledgments
- DON'T interrupt while they're explaining

## Techniques

- &quot;When you say [technical term], do you mean...?&quot;

## Avoiding Assumptions

- &quot;I appreciate you bringing this to our attention...&quot;

<h2 id="4-clear-communication_1">4. Clear Communication</h2>
<h3 id="41-technical-translation">4.1 Technical Translation</h3>
<pre class="codehilite"><code class="language-markdown">## Simplify Technical Terms
Instead of: &quot;The DNS resolution failed&quot;
