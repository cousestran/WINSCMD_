# 🔍 Methodical Troubleshooting & Knowledge Management Guide

## 1. Structured Troubleshooting Methodology

### 1.1 The 7-Step Troubleshooting Process
```markdown
1. **Problem Identification**
   - Gather detailed symptom information
   - Document error messages verbatim
   - Identify patterns or recent changes
   - Determine scope and impact

2. **Establish a Theory**
   - List probable causes (most to least likely)
   - Consider recent changes or updates
   - Check system/network documentation
   - Consult knowledge base articles

3. **Test the Theory**
   - Start with simplest solutions first
   - Use diagnostic tools and commands
   - Document each test and result
   - Narrow down root cause

   - Outline resolution steps
   - Consider potential impacts
   - Prepare rollback procedures
   - Get necessary approvals

5. **Implement the Solution**
   - Follow change management procedures
   - Make one change at a time
   - Document each step taken
   - Verify after each change

6. **Verify Full Functionality**
   - Test all related functionality
   - Confirm with end user
   - Check system logs for errors
   - Ensure no new issues introduced
